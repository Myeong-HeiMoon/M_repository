# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository consists of the files about Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. 

The dataset being used is: HCI HAR Dataset

There is R sctipt file, run_analysis.R for performing analysis. It contains all of the code to perform the analysis dscribed by a few steps:
  1. Download the file and put the file in the data folder.
  2. Unzip the file.
  3. Read data from the files into the variables.
  4. Mergees the training and the test sets.
  5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  8. Creates a second, independent tidy data set and output it.

The end result is shown in the file tidydata.txt

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
